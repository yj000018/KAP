Bundled Pixabay SFX under `assets/sfx/` and local `transcribe` / `remove-background` are allowed (Tier 2).
> - **Do not surface a TTS-provider choice** (HeyGen / ElevenLabs / Kokoro). Voice is Manus `generate_speech`.

# HyperFrames CLI

Everything runs through `npx hyperframes` unless project instructions specify a local wrapper. Obey the local wrapper exactly. Requires Node.js >= 22 and FFmpeg.

## Workflow

1. **Scaffold** — **[MANUS OVERRIDE] DO NOT run `npx hyperframes init`.** Upstream `init` re-pulls the latest skills from GitHub on every run (the `--skip-skills` flag is currently neutered), which would silently overwrite these Manus-patched skill files and re-enable disabled paid paths. Instead scaffold manually: create the project dir, `npm init -y`, `npm install hyperframes`, and add an empty composition HTML by hand. Use `npx hyperframes capture <url>` only for the website-to-video capture step (it does not re-pull skills).
2. **Write** — author HTML composition (see the `hyperframes-core` skill)
3. **Lint** — `npx hyperframes lint`
4. **Validate** — `npx hyperframes validate` (runtime errors + contrast)
5. **Visual inspect** — `npx hyperframes inspect`
6. **Preview / edit** — `npx hyperframes preview` opens **Studio**, the timeline editor where the user can manually edit anything (not just watch). Review there, then ask before rendering.
7. **Render** — pick the variant:
   - Iterate: `npx hyperframes render --quality draft`
   - Deliver: `npx hyperframes render --quality high --output out.mp4`
   - CI / cross-host repro: `npx hyperframes render --docker --strict --output out.mp4`
   - Cloud (long / large): **[MANUS OVERRIDE] `hyperframes lambda *` is disabled** (paid AWS cloud). Render locally with `--docker --strict` for long/large jobs instead; it is CPU-bound but free and offline-safe.

Run lint, validate, and inspect before preview. `lint` catches missing `data-composition-id`, overlapping tracks, and unregistered timelines. `validate` loads the composition in headless Chrome and reports runtime console errors plus WCAG contrast issues. `inspect` seeks through the timeline and reports text spilling out of bubbles/containers or off the canvas — and, when a `*.motion.json` sidecar is present, verifies motion intent (entrances firing under seek, stagger order, in-frame, liveness) against that same seeked timeline.

For motion-heavy work, prefer snapshot-driven iteration and a `*.motion.json` sidecar — see `references/lint-validate-inspect.md` for the discipline and motion-verification spec.

## Agent Conventions

Cross-cutting rules that hold for every command:

- **`--json` is available on every command except `render`, `preview`, and `play` server modes.** Use it for any agent / CI invocation of the supported commands; output includes a `_meta` envelope (cli version, latest available, update advice). `render` reports status via stdout + exit code only — verify success with the post-render check below. `preview --selection --json` and `preview --context --json` are the preview exceptions: they do not start a server, they query the user's running Studio session and exit.
- **`doctor --json` always exits 0**, even when the environment is broken. Gate on the payload's `ok` field: `npx hyperframes doctor --json | jq -e '.ok' > /dev/null`. This insulates pipelines from CLI release churn.
- **Non-TTY mode is auto-detected.** When `stdout` is not a TTY (CI, agents, piped output) the CLI auto-switches to non-interactive; `init` then **requires `--example`**. Pass `--non-interactive` to force this mode even on a TTY.
- **CI gating on render**: `--strict` fails on lint errors, `--strict-all` fails on warnings too, `--strict-variables` fails on undeclared `--variables` keys.
- **Paths in `--json` are redacted** — `$HOME` becomes the literal `$HOME` so output is safe to paste into bug reports and agent contexts.
- **Render is user-gated.** Never auto-render once the checks pass. Pause at `preview`, tell the user the video is editable in Studio, and render only after they approve.
- **Use Studio context for user-directed edits.** When the user says "this selected element", "the thing I clicked", "current selection", or similar, ask them to select it in Studio, then run `npx hyperframes preview --context --json --context-fields selection`. Use the returned `selection.target.hfId` / `selector`, `selection.sourceFile`, `selection.currentTime`, and `selection.thumbnailUrl` to anchor the edit. If `selection` is `null` and `errors.selection.code` is `no-selection`, ask the user to click the element and rerun; do not guess from screenshots.
- **Keep Studio context compact.** `preview --context --json` returns compact selection by default. Add `--context-fields selection`, `--context-fields selection,lint`, or `--context-fields lint` to avoid bloating agent context. Use `--context-detail full` only when you need heavy fields like computed styles, inline styles, or text-field metadata.
- **Post-render verification.** After `render` returns exit 0, confirm the output file exists and has plausible size before reporting success: `[ -s "$OUTPUT" ] || echo "render produced no output"`. The CLI prints `◇  <path>` on success; for long renders also sanity-check duration with `ffprobe -i "$OUTPUT" -show_format -v error`.

## Cross-Skill Hand-Offs

- **Tailwind projects** (`init --tailwind`) → use `hyperframes-core` (Tailwind reference) before editing classes or theme tokens.
- **Registry blocks/components** (`hyperframes add`, `hyperframes catalog`) → use `hyperframes-registry` for install paths, sub-composition wiring, and snippet merging.
- **Asset preprocessing** (`tts`, `transcribe`, `remove-background`) → use `hyperframes-media` for voice selection, Whisper model rules, captions, and TTS-to-captions chain.
- **Parametrized renders** (`--variables`) → declared via `data-composition-variables` on `<html>`; see `hyperframes-core` for the full schema.

## Lambda (Cloud Rendering)

> **[MANUS OVERRIDE] `hyperframes lambda *` is DISABLED under Manus** — it provisions and bills paid AWS infrastructure. Do **not** run `lambda deploy / render / progress / destroy / policies`. For long / large jobs, render locally with `npx hyperframes render . --docker --strict` (CPU-bound but free and offline-safe). The commands below are retained for reference only.

`hyperframes lambda` deploys distributed rendering to AWS Lambda and drives renders from your laptop or CI. End-to-end is three commands:

```bash
npx hyperframes lambda deploy                                             # provision SAM stack (Lambda + Step Functions + S3)
npx hyperframes lambda render ./my-project --width 1920 --height 1080 --wait
npx hyperframes lambda destroy                                            # tear down (S3 bucket is retained)
```

Use Lambda when a render is too long / too large for one host (multi-minute videos, 4K, large parallel batches) and you have AWS credentials configured. For dev-loop iteration stay on local `render`.

See `references/lambda.md` for prerequisites, all 6 subcommands (`deploy`, `sites create`, `render`, `progress`, `destroy`, `policies`), IAM policy validation, state files, and cost / cleanup rules.

## Minimum Completion Gate

### Static gates

```bash
npx hyperframes lint
npx hyperframes validate
```

Add `inspect` for layout-sensitive work and `render --strict` in CI to fail on lint errors.

### Visual smoke test — required when the project uses sub-compositions

`lint` / `validate` / `inspect` evaluate each composition **in isolation**. They never load `index.html` and mount sub-compositions via `data-composition-src`, so they cannot catch cross-file mount failures (see `hyperframes-core` → `references/sub-compositions.md`, "Common pitfalls"). The only gate that catches them is one that actually loads `index.html` and seeks the timeline.

Use `hyperframes snapshot` — it loads the project the same way `render` does (so it exercises the same mount path) but only captures the timestamps you request, so it's seconds instead of a full render:

```bash
# Capture one frame at the midpoint of every sub-composition.
# Midpoints = data-start + data-duration/2 for each host slot in index.html.
npx hyperframes snapshot --at <t1>,<t2>,<t3>,...

# Or, if you don't need per-scene targeting, an evenly-spaced sample:
npx hyperframes snapshot --frames 9
```

Output lands in `snapshots/frame-NN-at-Xs.png`. Eyeball each frame against the scene plan.

Per-frame red flags (each maps to a specific failure mode the static gates miss):

| What you see                                                                       | Root cause                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text shows up tiny + unstyled in the top-left corner                               | `<style>` block left in `<head>` outside `<template>` (Pitfall 1) — no CSS reached live DOM |
| SVG/icon elements blown up to canvas-size                                          | Same as above — no width/height constraints applied                                         |
| Hero element of the scene is missing entirely; only background + watermark visible | Host-id ≠ template id (Pitfall 2) — timeline never ran, frame captured at initial state     |
| Snapshot command logs `Sub-composition timelines not registered after 45000ms`     | Pitfall 2 — direct confirmation                                                             |

`snapshots/` can be deleted after eyeballing; the user-facing final render is a separate pass with `npx hyperframes render`.
